> A  SCP: Secret Laboratory PluginAPI plugin that re-creates Auto-Nuke feature with a custom C.A.S.S.I.E. voiceline and configurable timer.

Just edit the config to your liking.
Also I didn't find a way to silence C.A.S.S.I.E. for only Sigma announcement to play, please make a PR if you do.

### Installation
Drop the .dll from Releases into .config/SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/global (or replace global with port number if you don't want it on all servers)

The plugin will generate a config.yml into a folder next to the .dll file.
